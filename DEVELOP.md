# Controls
The controls are located in "ui/controls/overview.coffee". Before you decide what you want to do you have to choose wether your control triggers a single operation or a chain of operations.
If you want to add a custom control you have to implement it and require it in the list as described below. 
Weâ€™ll take it easy and start with a single operation - in order to do so the flag singleOperation has to be true. You also have to specify the operation in the @operationClass.

```
class UIControlsStickers extends List
  cssClassIdentifier: "sticker"
  singleOperation: true
  displayButtons: true

  ###
    @param {imglyUtil} app
    @param {imglyUtil.UI} ui
  ###
  constructor: (@app, @ui, @controls) ->
    super

    @operationClass = require "../../operations/draw_image.coffee"

    @listItems = [
      {
        name: "Heart"
        cssClass: "sticker"
        method: "useSticker"
        arguments: ["Heart"]
        default: true
      },
      {
        name: "NyanCat"
        cssClass: "nyanCat"
        method: "useSticker"
        arguments: ["NyanCat"]
      }
    ]
```

When the operation is processed an instance of the class specified in @operationClass will be created and on that instance the method specified in method with the arguments specified in arguments will be called. The list item with default: true will be active when you open the editor.

The option displayButtons will add a back and apply button.

# Operations
Operation are the heart of manipulating the canvas object. If you want to create a custom operation you have to implement it in the operations folder and then require it by your custom control.

Settings from the UI control, for example the position and size, can be passed
via the @operationOptions variable (which is being set by @operation.setOptions).

# Adding new stickers
Sticker files have to follow the naming convention stickers/sticker-{name}.png. In order to add new stickers, the stickerContainer list has to be extended both in the coffeescript and the sass file.
